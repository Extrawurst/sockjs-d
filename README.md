sockjs-d
========

See test project of a sockjs web client connecting and exchanging messages with a vibe.d server.

Note:
This is xhr-polling transport only right now, since it is meant to work with 
sockjs for unity-free (https://github.com/Extrawurst/sockjs-unity3d-xhr).
If anyone wants to contribute other transports, just fork and I will pull ;)
